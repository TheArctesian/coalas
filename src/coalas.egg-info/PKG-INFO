## Overview

This aims to be the simplest way of handling CSV files.

I was pissed off with how pandas handled data, so I think I am going to make my own. Also pandas has a data limit of 50MB which is kinda stupid I may also be using it wrong. But anyways this is limited to the ram in your computer so have fun.

## Install

```sh
pip install coalas
```

## Upgrade

```sh
pip install coalas --upgrade
```

## Use

At the begging of your file import the data using the function

```py
from coalas import coalas as c
c.importData("filename")
c.printAll()
```

This will bring all the data from your CSV and init them to arrays with that are named after your headers.

Example:
If I have a csv file like this:

```
foo,bar,biz
james,lars,kirk
john,paul,george #sorry ringo
gilmour,barret,waters
```

after importing the data you will get the arrays:

```py
foo = ['james', 'john', 'gilmour']
bar = ['lars', 'paul', 'barret']
biz = ['kirk', 'george', 'waters']
```

You can the mutate the state of the arrays with normal python functionality or for more CSV specific functions use the function detailed in the wiki page

## Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute, please look at the todo file for task that remain unfinished, or audit the code. In general use your rational judgment, don't submit anything malicious or project breaking, I or any maintainers will check. Don't be afraid to do anything radical or delete large swaths of code, take risks and innovate.

The only requirement I will set is that you write a log of your work in the `log.md` file. Follow the format. This **must be done** before and after every session. While this might seem tedious and monotonous, it allows me other to acknowledge the effort you have put it to helping the open source community. It as also fun to go back read anecdotes and relive the pain or jubilation the past.

## Thanks

Thanks to @Stelercus for the name, had to change it to `coalas` instead of `koalas` because `koalas` wass already taken
